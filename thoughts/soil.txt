on update call:
soil water level can evaporate
plant can drink soil water level
plant can use (lose) water level
plant can grow

first determine which of the three will happen first.
do that. loop again.

on evaporate:
we want the timestamp to go up by the amount of the evaporate timer
we want the other timers to decrease by that amount
we want the water level to decrease by 1
we want to reset the evaporate timer to the soil evaporate rate

if something else update
we want to get the time passed
subtract that from the time left
if it's less than or equal to zero, use default time, otherwise use new time
