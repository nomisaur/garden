maybe water level is in the soil

soil continuosly dries

plants continuosly drink

soil has water level
plants have water level

plants suck water from soil
soil loses water from plants and from air

plants gain water at certain rate when soil is wet
plants lose water at certain rate when soil is dry

need soil state.

different kinds of soil with different rates?
- worry about that later
- no, worry now

water level can be from 0...99, for plants and soil
plants can have defined ranges of healthy, dry, wet, etc
for each phase:
dry: 0-19, healthy: 20-79, wet: 80-99
rate of drying: 1 every duration
